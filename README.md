ADVANCED CSS GRID
===================
Review
-----------
Great work! You have learned many new properties to use when creating a layout using CSS Grid! Let’s review:

1. grid-template-areas specifies grid named grid areas
2. grid layouts are two-dimensional: they have a row, or inline, axis and a column, or block, axis.
3. justify-items specifies how individual elements should spread across the row axis
4. justify-content specifies how groups of elements should spread across the row axis
5. justify-self specifies how a single element should position itself with respect to the row axis
6. align-items specifies how individual elements should spread across the column axis
7. align-content specifies how groups of elements should spread across the column axis
8. align-self specifies how a single element should position itself with respect to the column axis
9. grid-auto-rows specifies the height of rows added implicitly to the grid
10. grid-auto-columns specifies the width of columns added implicitly to the grid
11. grid-auto-flow specifies in which direction implicit elements should be created

This is a great time to experiment with the code in the code editor and try any of the properties you want to practice more! When you’re ready, move on!
